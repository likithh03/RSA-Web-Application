# RSA Encryption Tool (Client-Side)

This project is a client-side RSA encryption tool built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It uses the Web Crypto API to generate RSA keys, encrypt messages with the public key, and decrypt them with the private key.

## Features
- Generates 2048-bit RSA keys.
- Encrypts messages using the public key.
- Decrypts messages using the private key.
- All operations are performed in the browser.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/likithh03/RSA-Web-Application.git
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Use the interface to generate keys, encrypt, and decrypt messages.
