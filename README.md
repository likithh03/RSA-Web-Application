# RSA Encryption and Decryption

This project implements RSA encryption and decryption, along with digital signatures, to demonstrate secure communication.

## Features
- RSA Key Generation
- Message Encryption and Decryption
- Digital Signatures and Verification

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- SymPy (for prime number generation)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the `example_usage.py` script to see RSA in action.

    Example:
    ```bash
    python example_usage.py
    ```

    You will see:
    - Encrypted message
    - Decrypted message (which should match the original message)
    - Signature for the message
    - Verification of the signature

## Example

- Input message: "This is a secret message."
- Encrypted message: (example output here)
- Decrypted message: "This is a secret message."
- Signature: (example signature output here)
- Signature verification: True

## Credits
- RSA implementation inspired by public key cryptography principles.
